# Pitman-Translator
An English to Pitman Shorthand translator using the CMULexicon for pronunciation.

## What is Shorthand?
Shorthand is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed and brevity of writing. Historically 
it has been used to take down speeches and public addresses verbatim during speech, and then is recorded in
long hand later. This is the reason that we have so many verbatim records from ancient Rome, and other sources
from before recording technology was available.

## What is Pitman?
There are many forms of shorthand, each with their own quirks and benefits. Pitman Shorthand is one of these forms.
It was developed in 1837 by a Sir Isaac Pitman. It combines thin and broad strokes to get more meaning out of 
minimal different forms. It is based purely on phonetics, so it is not language specific. However, this makes 
machine transcribing difficult since there needs to be a pronunciation guide for each locale, instead of just 
going through the characters. 

## So what does this program do?
This program takes a sentence(At the moment only in English) and displays the Pitman shorthand representation
of that sentence. 

**Important notice**:
